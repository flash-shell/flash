# âš¡ flash

flash, a shell written in C.

## Philosophy
This project was completed as part of a shell project we undertook in our 2nd year of undergraduate studies. We primarily focused on functionality, but ensured that the shell is minimalistic, yet pleasurable to use and look at. While this project is not in a usable state in comparison to other shells available, it draws inspiration from other shells such as PowerShell & bash, and we are proud of what we have achieved with this project.

## Installation
1. Clone the git repository.
2. Compile it with your compiler of choice (gcc was used in the creation of the project).
3. Lastly run the shell.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps below:

1. Head over to the official stable [releases](https://github.com/flash-shell/flash/releases) page.
2. Download the executable for your system, then proceed to run the shell.

Or,

1. Run it with the provided makefile: `make`
2. And then run the shell via `flash`.

After that, you're ready to use the shell.
